## Concept Clarification:
based off elemental awakening

## Gameplay Mechanics:
obtaining spins, spinning for rarities, leveling up, and using items for luck boosts

## Rarity System:
common (89%), uncommon (74%), rare (61%), epic (25%), unique (5%), legendary (0.5%), exotic (0.15%), divine (0.1%) 

## Leveling System:
TBD

## Bot Commands:
/spin, /inventory (shows equipped items too), /level, /equip, /battle, /achievements, /buffs, /shop

## User Experience:
proper error handling (treat as if they're sped), tutorial, **needs lore**
to add onto this, lets add fonts to the bot replies to make it seem more interactive

## Game Economy:
currency will be based off of the number of spins and how rare your element is

## Progression and Engagement:
to keep long term user playback, we'll make events and unobtainable achievements. The leaderboard will be TBD and special events will be handled later on


## Testing and Feedback:
ill start by inviting all my friends to test and use the bot and get their feedback to see how to get users to become addicted and have fun


## Community Building:
for the community, we'll host events, create lore, and be socially engaged for users to add their own lore which'll continue to forever build and create **arks**
